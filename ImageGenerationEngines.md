# The World Has Changed

Editor's Note: This was written in September 2022. At the time, I wanted to add more about what I thought image generators would be used for, but I've decided to publish this version for posterity.
The world has changed and almost nobody knows it yet.
Today is September 6th, 2022. The 3 main image generation engines are DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney. (The date is important the leading engines could be different a week from now.)
Two months ago, the creation of digital artwork cost $100's dollars or $1000's dollars an image and photography cost $10's and $1000's per image. Today, the creation of digital images costs cents. Images can now be generated in seconds, by giving an image generation engine a text prompt and by fiddling two or three simple parameters
DALL-E 2 was released on July 20nd, 2022. It was created by OpenAI one of the world’s leading research laboratories. OpenAI has XX. It was closed-sourced and available initially only to beta testers on the waitlist. OpenAI distorted any faces in images making it hard to be used for deepfakes.
Stable Diffusion was released on August 22, 2022, 33 days later by Stability AI. Stable Diffusion is open source, can run a GPU, and doesn't blur faces like DALL-E 2. Stability AI, as of August 12th, 2022, has 75 employees.

The images aren’t prefect. They still gave off a weird vibe. And giving the right words to get the image you want (prompt engineering) is still a bit finicky. But an hour after I started playing with Stable Diffusion, I was able to create this image of an Canadian Flag and an Astronaut on the moon. (So can you with Stable Diffusion on commit a9758cbfbd5f with width 512 height 512 prompt Neil Armstrong on the Moon Canadian Flag num_outputs 4 guidance_scale 7 prompt_strength 0.8 num_inference_steps 129 and seed 47692).
-Soon for videos, etc
-Fundmenatlly a different medium
Changes
—Deepfakes
—Creative labour
—New arts created (Comic book etc)
—Programitic creation (See what clothes on you look like, what amazon things look like your how)
— Meaning of non human created artwork? Creative work of selection??
Can’t be put back in the box.
This felt different
We were/aren’t ready. We won’t be ready for the next big on
